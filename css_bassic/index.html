            <p>
                There are many types of Public Speaking, including Informative, Persuasive, Entertaining, and Demonstrative. Unlike Informative Speaking, which conveys information, in Persuasive Speaking, the Speaker aims to convince the audience of something. Entertaining Speaking focuses on entertaining the audience, while Demonstrative Speaking involves showing how something is done.
