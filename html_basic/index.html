    <h1>What is Public Speaking?</h1>
    <p>Public Speaking is, simply, an oral presentation or speech delivered to a live audience. It is genera
    lly a formal or staged event-although impromptu speeches are a common occurrence-and can be a defining c
    areer moment.</p>
    <h2>Types of Public Speaking.</h2>
    <p>There are many types of Public Speaking including, Informative Speaking, Persuasive Speaking, Entertaining Speaking, and Demonstrative Speaking. Unlike Informative Speaking that conveys information, in Persuasive Speaking, the Speaker's aim is to convince the audience of something. Entertaining Speaking focuses on entertaining the audience, while Demonstrative Speaking involves showing how something is done.</p>
    <h3>How do people perceive public speaking?</h3>
    <p>People perceive public speaking in different ways, often influenced by their individual experiences and personalities.</p>
    <p>Many people feel anxious about speaking in public. The fear of being judged, making mistakes, or forgetting what to say can be overwhelming. Some view public speaking as an opportunity to share their ideas, inspire others, and create positive change. They feel empowered by the chance to communicate effectively. While this may not be the overall perception of public speaking, the majority of people perceive public speaking this way.</p>
